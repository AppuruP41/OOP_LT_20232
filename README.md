## 2. Project Details
Language: Java
Apps used: Scene Builder, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse
### Overview: 
Design a program to display and explain some basic operations four types of tree:Generic tree, Binary tree, Balanced tree, Balanced binary tree
Operations:  create, insert, delete, update, traverse, search.<br />
**Design:**
Consider only undirected-weight trees, with integer node values and no duplicated node values allowed.<br />
For the balanced tree and balanced binary tree, the maximum difference in distance from root of the leaf nodes must be chosen by the user.
On the main menu: title of the application, navigation bar for user to choose between the four types of tree, help menu and quit.<br />
-	User must select a type of data structure before getting into the visualization.<br />
-	The help menu shows basic usage and aim of the project.<br />
-	Quit button exits the application, ask for confirmation.<br />
**In the visualization:**
- Menu of six operations.
- Pseudo Code and Process area.
- Undo and Redo button.
- Back button.
